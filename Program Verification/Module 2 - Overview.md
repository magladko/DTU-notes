# Goal: build a verifier for a toy programming language

- **The Ground-Truth**: what is a "correct" toy program
- **Floyd-Hoare (Program) Logic**: how do we write formal correctness proofs on paper?
- **Soundness**: why can we trust our proofs?
- **Completeness**: what can we prove?
- **Automation**: how do we systematically construct proofs?
