# Heaps and Objects - Program Verification Notes

## Introduction
> [!note] 
> This module moves from previous foundations and local memory to heap-based memory and objects, essential for understanding advanced program verification concepts.

## 1. Why Objects & Heap-Based Data Structures?

### Static vs Dynamic Data Structures
> [!important]
> **Static Data Structures**:
> - Fixed size, stack-allocated
> - Immutable, no memory reuse
> - Examples: arrays, mathematical data structures
> - Updates create new copies
>
> **Dynamic Data Structures**:
> - Dynamic size, heap-allocated 
> - Mutable
> - Examples: resizable arrays, linked lists, trees
> - In-place modifications

### Memory Safety Issues
Common problems include:
- Null pointer dereference
- Dangling pointers
- Double-free or use-after-free bugs
- Data races
- Memory leaks

> [!info] Important Context
> According to Microsoft research, ~70% of all security vulnerabilities are caused by memory safety issues.

## 2. Memory Model

### Program Memory Layout
Memory is divided into two main components:
1. **Stack Memory**:
   - Managed by compiler/runtime
   - Traditional model: $\mathfrak{m}: \text{Var} \rightarrow \text{Val}$

2. **Heap Memory**:
   - Managed by programmer
   - Extended model: $\mathfrak{m} = (s,h)$ where:
     - $s: \text{Var} \rightarrow \text{Val}$ (stack)
     - $h: \text{Objects} \times \text{Fields} \rightarrow \text{Val} \cup \{\text{undef}\}$ (heap)

### Access Permissions System
The system introduces:
1. **Permission Predicates**
   - `acc(x.f)` denotes permission to access field f of object x
   - Permissions are exclusive (at most one holder)

2. **Separating Conjunction**
   - Notation: $*$ ("and separately")
   - `F * G` means formulas F and G hold on disjoint portions of heap

> [!warning] Key Principle
> A field can only be accessed if permission is held for it.

## 3. Verification Rules

### Field Access Rules
```
Field Read:
{{ acc(e.f) * H[x ≔ e.f] }} x := e.f {{ acc(e.f) * H }}

Field Update:
{{ acc(x.f) * x.f == N }} x.f := e {{ acc(e.f) * x.f == e[x.f ≔ N] }}
```

### Frame Rule for Heap
```
{{ F }} C {{ G }}
{{ F * H }} C {{ G * H }}
```
Where C does not modify variables free in frame H.

## Common Operations

### Inhale Operation
- Purpose: Gain permissions and assume logical constraints
- Syntax: `inhale F`
- Effects:
  1. Obtains required permissions
  2. Assumes logical constraints

### Exhale Operation
- Purpose: Check, remove permissions and enforce constraints
- Syntax: `exhale F`
- Effects:
  1. Asserts logical constraints
  2. Removes required permissions
  3. Havocs lost locations

> [!tip] Implementation Note
> All heap operations must consider aliasing effects in their implementations.

## Definitions

- **Memory Safety**: The absence of errors related to memory accesses (null dereference, use after free, etc.)
- **Aliasing**: When multiple references point to the same object in memory
- **Framing**: The concept of local reasoning about heap portions relevant to a specific operation
- **Separating Conjunction**: Logical operator that ensures formulas hold on disjoint portions of heap

## Key Theorems/Rules

1. **Allocation Rule**:
```
{{ emp }} x := new(f) {{ acc(e.f) }}
```

2. **Field Access Rules** (with permissions):
```
{{ acc(e.f) }} x := e.f {{ acc(e.f) }}
{{ acc(x.f) }} x.f := e {{ acc(x.f) }}
```

3. **Frame Rule**: 
```
{{ F }} C {{ G }}
{{ F * H }} C {{ G * H }}
```

## 4. Encoding Heap Operations

### Basic Types and Structures
```typescript
type Ref              // reference type
const null: Ref       // null reference
type Field T         // polymorphic field type
type HeapType = Map<T>[(Ref, Field T), T]  // heap mapping
type MaskType = Map<T>[(Ref, Field T), bool]  // permission mask
```

### Permission Management
1. **Permission Mask**
   - Global tracking of permissions
   - Maps (reference, field) pairs to boolean values
   - Convention: `¬Mask[null, f]` for all fields f

2. **Field Access Control**
```
v := x.f  →  assert Mask[x,f]; v := Heap[x,f]
x.f := e  →  assert Mask[x,f]; Heap[x,f] := e
```

### Inhale/Exhale Implementation

#### Inhale Operation
```python
inhale pure     →  assume pure
inhale acc(e.f) →  assume ¬Mask[E,f]; Mask[E,f] := true
inhale F && G   →  inhale F; inhale G
```

#### Exhale Operation (Fixed Version)
```python
var oldMask: MaskType
var newHeap: HeapType
oldMask := Mask
// Check permissions and constraints
exhale P  
// Delay havoc until end
assume forall y,g :: Mask[y,g] ==> newHeap[y,g] == Heap[y,g]
Heap := newHeap
```

## 5. Challenges and Solutions

### Major Verification Challenges
1. **Aliasing**
   - ✅ Solved through permissions and separating conjunction
   - Prevents issues with multiple references modifying same memory

2. **Framing**
   - 🟨 Partially solved
   - Sound frame rule exists
   - Still needs support for unbounded data structures

3. **Information Hiding**
   - ❌ Not fully solved
   - Specifications need improvement for better encapsulation

4. **Concurrent Programs**
   - 🟨 Foundation laid with permissions
   - Additional mechanisms needed for full concurrency support

> [!tip] Exam Tips
> - Focus on understanding the interplay between permissions and memory safety
> - Practice applying the frame rule in different contexts
> - Be able to explain how permission transfer works in method calls
> - Understand the differences between stack and heap memory management

## Practical Implications

1. **Method Calls**
   - Permissions transfer from caller to callee
   - Return transfers permissions back
   - Frame rule preserves untouched heap portions

2. **Memory Safety**
   - Automatically verified through permission system
   - Prevents common issues like null dereference
   - Handles deallocation safety

3. **Loop Handling**
   - Loop invariants must include permission information
   - Permissions transfer in/out of loop body
   - Framing around loops preserves unmodified state

> [!note] Viper Implementation
> All these concepts are implemented in Viper verifier, making it a practical tool for verifying heap-manipulating programs.

   ensures acc(x.f) && x.f == old(x.f) + 1
   {
     x.f := x.f + 1
   }
   ```
   - Verifying specifications are correct
   - Finding errors in permission usage
   - Explaining why certain code doesn't verify

### Practice Problems Focus Areas

1. **Permission Stories**
   - Tracking permission flow through program
   - Understanding permission transfer in method calls
   - Identifying permission leaks

2. **Aliasing Issues**
   ```python
   # Common aliasing pattern to analyze
   x := new(f)
   y := x
   // What permissions exist here?
   ```

3. **Frame Rule Applications**
   - When frame rule applies/doesn't apply
   - How framing interacts with permissions
   - Local vs. global reasoning

> [!warning] Common Pitfalls
> - Forgetting to check permissions before field access
> - Incorrect handling of aliasing in specifications
> - Misunderstanding permission transfer in method calls

### Applied Verification Examples

1. **Method Specifications**
```viper
method swap(a: Ref, b: Ref)
  requires acc(a.f) && acc(b.f)
  ensures acc(a.f) && acc(b.f)
  ensures a.f == old(b.f) && b.f == old(a.f)
```

2. **Loop Invariants with Heap**
```viper
while (x != null)
  invariant acc(x.f)
{
  // Body maintaining permissions
}
```

> [!note] Key Verification Principles
> 1. Always track permissions explicitly
> 2. Consider aliasing effects in specifications
> 3. Use separating conjunction for clear permission separation
> 4. Remember that memory safety is guaranteed through permissions
