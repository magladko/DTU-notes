# Permission Models Notes

## Core Concepts and Motivation

### Why Advanced Permission Models?
Current permission model limitations when dealing with:
1. Dynamic data structures with complex sharing:
   > [!example] Problem Cases
   > - Doubly-linked lists (unclear who should hold field permissions)
   > - Random-access data structures
   > - Arbitrary cyclic data structures

2. Data structure traversals not following predicate definitions:
   - Iterative traversals where recursive predicates are cumbersome

## Two Advanced Permission Models

### 1. Fractional Permissions
- Allow splitting and re-combining permissions
- Permission amount π is a rational number in [0,1]
- Viper syntax:
  ```viper
  acc(t.f)         // shortcut for acc(t.f, write)
  acc(t.f, 1/2)    // half permission
  acc(t.f, write)  // full permission (1/1)
  acc(t.f, none)   // no permission (0/1)
  ```

> [!important] Permission Rules
> - Field read requires non-zero permission
> - Field write requires full (write) permission
> - Zero permission means no access

### 2. Quantified Permissions
- Allow permissions in universal quantifiers
- Useful for:
  - Unbounded data structures
  - Random access patterns
  - Complex sharing scenarios

```viper
// Example of quantified permission
forall x: Ref :: x in s ==> acc(x.f)
```

## Practical Applications

### Sharing in Data Structures

1. **Fractional Permissions for Sharing:**
```viper
predicate sharedCell(this: Ref) {
    acc(this.cell) && acc(this.cell.val, 1/2)
}
```

2. **Arrays Implementation:**
```viper
field val: Int // for integer arrays
domain Array {
    function loc(a: Array, i: Int): Ref
    function len(a: Array): Int
}
```

### Well-formed Quantified Permissions
> [!note] Key Rule
> For each assertion `acc(t.f)` under a `forall x:T`, t must be injective for all instantiations x1, x2:
> ```
> x1 != x2 ==> t[x ↦ x1] != t[x ↦ x2]
> ```

## Common Patterns and Best Practices

1. **For Reading Operations:**
   - Use fractional permissions (any non-zero amount)
   - Consider using wildcard permissions

2. **For Writing Operations:**
   - Require full permissions
   - Must handle permission recombination

3. **For Data Structures:**
   - Use quantified permissions for random access
   - Use fractional permissions for shared resources

## Advanced Features

### The Perm Type
```viper
field frac: Perm
method cloneList(this: Ref, p: Perm) returns (res: Ref)
    requires acc(list(this), p)
    ensures acc(list(this), p) && list(res)
```

### Arrays with Quantified Permissions
```viper
// Permission to all array elements
forall i: Int :: 0 <= i && i < len(a) ==> acc(loc(a, i).val)
```

> [!warning] Common Pitfalls
> - Trying to recombine wildcard permissions
> - Not handling permission fractions correctly in loops
> - Incorrect handling of shared mutable state

## Case Studies and Examples

### Binary Reference Counting Case Study

> [!note] Key Concepts
> - Optimizes code using immutable data
> - Tracks whether data is shared
> - Uses copy-on-write for shared data updates
> - Performs destructive updates on unshared data
> - Once shared, data doesn't return to unshared state

```viper
field data: Ref
field shared: Bool
field val: Seq[Int]

predicate segment(this: Ref) {
    acc(this.data) && 
    acc(this.data.shared, this.frac) && 
    acc(this.data.val, this.frac)
}
```

### Graph Marking Example

```viper
field next: Set[Ref]
field flag: Bool

define graph(nodes) (
    forall n: Ref :: n in nodes ==> 
        acc(n.next) && acc(n.flag) && 
        (n.next subset nodes)
)
```

> [!important] Features Demonstrated
> - Complex sharing patterns
> - Arbitrary traversal orders
> - Mutable state management
> - Permission tracking across data structure

## Implementation Details

### Adjusted Encoding for Permissions

1. **Permission Mask:**
```viper
type MaskType = Map<T>[(Ref, Field T), Real]
var Mask: MaskType
```

2. **Field Access Rules:**
```viper
// Read requires non-zero permission
assert Mask[x,f] > 0.0
v := Heap[x,f]

// Write requires full permission
assert Mask[x,f] == 1.0
Heap[x,f] := t
```

### Permission Operations

1. **Separating Conjunction:**
```viper
acc(x.f, 1/2) && acc(x.f, 1/2) 
// is equivalent to 
acc(x.f, 1/1)
```

2. **Permission Transfer:**
```viper
// inhale adds permissions
// exhale subtracts permissions and havocs only when all permission is removed
```

## Advanced Applications

### Working with Arrays

```viper
domain Array {
    function loc(a: Array, i: Int): Ref
    function len(a: Array): Int
    function first(r: Ref): Array
    function second(r: Ref): Int
    
    axiom injectivity {
        forall a: Array, i: Int :: {loc(a, i)}
        first(loc(a, i)) == a && second(loc(a, i)) == i
    }
}
```

### Two-Dimensional Arrays Extension

```viper
domain TwoDimArray {
    function loc(a: TwoDimArray, i: Int, j: Int): Ref
    function len1(a: TwoDimArray): Int
    function len2(a: TwoDimArray): Int
}

define array(a) (
    forall i: Int, j: Int :: 
        0 <= i && i < len1(a) && 
        0 <= j && j < len2(a) ==> 
        acc(loc(a, i, j).val)
)
```

## Key Takeaways

> [!summary] Important Points
> 1. Fractional permissions enable fine-grained access control
> 2. Quantified permissions complement recursive predicates
> 3. Advanced permission models solve complex sharing scenarios
> 4. Proper permission management is crucial for verification
> 5. Each model has specific use cases and trade-offs

## Exam Tips

> [!tip] For the Exam
> - Be able to explain why advanced permission models are needed
> - Understand the differences between fractional and quantified permissions
> - Know how to handle common data structures with both permission types
> - Be prepared to discuss permission-related verification challenges
> - Practice writing specifications using both permission models

## Key Definitions

1. **Fractional Permission**: A permission amount π that is a rational number in [0,1], used to distinguish between read and write access.

2. **Quantified Permission**: Permission specification using universal quantifiers, allowing permissions to an unbounded set of locations.

3. **Permission Mask**: A mapping that tracks permission amounts for each memory location.

4. **Well-formed Quantified Permission**: A permission specification where the receiver expressions are injective.

5. **Wildcard Permission**: A special permission amount that represents some unspecified, non-zero fraction.

Let's finish up with the final concepts from Module 11.

# More Advanced Permission Features and Extensions

## Array Operations Pattern
1. **Common Operations:**
```viper
// Basic array access pattern
method lookup(a: Array, i: Int) returns (res: Int)
    requires array(a) && 0 <= i && i < len(a)
    ensures array(a)
{
    res := loc(a, i).val
}
```

## Example: Binary Search Implementation with Permissions
```viper
method binarySearch(a: Array, v: Int) returns (index: Int)
    requires array(a) // Permission to whole array
    requires sorted(a) // Array must be sorted
    ensures array(a)
{
    var low: Int := 0
    var high: Int := len(a) - 1
    
    while (low <= high)
        invariant array(a)
        invariant 0 <= low && high < len(a)
    {
        var mid: Int := (low + high) / 2
        var elem: Int := loc(a, mid).val
        
        if (elem == v) {
            index := mid
            return
        } else if (elem < v) {
            low := mid + 1
        } else {
            high := mid - 1
        }
    }
    index := -1
}
```
