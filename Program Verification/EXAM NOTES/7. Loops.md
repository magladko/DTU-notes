# Loops in Program Verification

## 1. Basic Concepts

### Loop Structure
A loop in program verification takes the form:
```
while (b) {
    c
}
```
where:
- $b$ is a Boolean expression (no quantifiers)
- $c$ is a command (loop body)

### Operational Semantics
The key rule for loop execution:

> $$\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{}
\UnaryInfC{$\tuple{\empha{\WhileDo{\bb}{\cc}}, \mem} ~\opStep~ \tuple{\Ite{\bb}{\cc\Seq\empha{\WhileDo{\bb}{\cc}}}{\Skip}, \mem}$}
\end{prooftree}$$

This shows that loops are executed by unrolling - first checking guard $b$, then either:
- Executing body $c$ and repeating if $b$ holds
- Terminating (skip) if $b$ doesn't hold

## 2. Verification Approach

### Partial Correctness
> A triple $\{P\}\textit{ while}(b)\{c\}\{Q\}$ is valid for partial correctness if:
- For all memories $\mem,\mem'$ where $\mem \models P$:
  - If execution terminates in $m'$, then $m' \models Q$
  - No execution aborts

### Loop Invariants
A formula $I$ is a loop invariant if:
1. It holds before first iteration
2. It's preserved by every iteration
3. Together with negation of guard implies postcondition

The key verification rule:
> $$\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\JudgeSyn \Triple{\emphc{\Inv}~\empha{\And~\bb}}{\cc}{\emphc{\Inv}}$}
\RightLabel{while}
\UnaryInfC{$\JudgeSyn \Triple{\emphc{\Inv}}{\WhileDo{\bb}{\cc}}{\emphc{\Inv}~\empha{\And~\Neg\bb}}$}
\end{prooftree}$$

## 3. Practical Verification Steps

### Finding Loop Invariants
1. Consider what properties must hold throughout execution
2. Properties should be:
   - Strong enough to prove postcondition
   - Weak enough to be preserved by loop body
   - Inductive (preserved by single iteration)

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Use assertions in the code to discover invariant candidates

### Common Invariant Patterns:
- Loop counter bounds
- Sum/product accumulation properties 
- Data structure properties
- Relationship between variables

## 4. Proving Termination

### Loop Variants
To prove termination, need a loop variant $V$ that:
1. Is non-negative integer expression
2. Decreases in each iteration
3. Has well-founded ordering

Syntax in Viper:
```
while (b)
    invariant I
    decreases V  // variant
{
    c
}
```

## 5. Verification Conditions

For loop verification, must prove:
1. $P \implies I$ (invariant holds initially)
2. $\{I \land b\}\ c\ \{I\}$ (invariant preserved)
3. $I \land \neg b \implies Q$ (postcondition achieved)

## Definitions & Theorems

> **Definition**: *Loop Invariant*  
> A formula $I$ is a loop invariant if it holds before every iteration of the loop and is preserved by the loop body.

> **Theorem**: *While Rule Soundness*  
> If $\models \{I \land b\}\ c\ \{I\}$ then $\models \{I\}\ \textit{while}(b)\{c\}\ \{I \land \neg b\}$

> **Definition**: *Loop Variant*  
> An expression $V$ that decreases in each loop iteration with respect to some well-founded ordering.

You're absolutely right - let me add a dedicated section about frame rules in loop verification.

## Frame Rule in Loop Verification

### Frame Rule Application
The frame rule for loops follows the same principle as for other commands:

> $$\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\JudgeSyn \Triple{\Pre}{\cc}{\Post}$}
\AxiomC{$\ModVarsOf{\cc} \cap \VarsOf{\fh} \eq \emptyset$}
\RightLabel{frame}
\BinaryInfC{$\JudgeSyn \Triple{\Pre \And \fh}{\cc}{\Post \And \fh}$}
\end{prooftree}$$

Where:
- $\text{ModVars}(c)$ is the set of variables modified by $c$
- $\text{Vars}(F)$ is the set of variables appearing in formula $F$

### Benefits for Loop Verification
- Properties of unmodified variables can be framed around the loop
- Simplifies loop invariants by separating concerns
- Enables local reasoning about loop behavior

### Example
```silver
{{ true }}
{{ true && 0 == 0 }}
x := 0;
{{ true && x == 0 }} // I && frame
while (false)
{
    // check loop invariant without frame
    {{ true && false }} // I && b (trivial)
    skip
    {{ true }} // I
};
{{ true && !false && x == 0 }} // I && !b && frame
{{ x == 0 && true }} // frame: x == 0
assert x == 0
{{ true }}
```

This example demonstrates how properties ($x == 0$) can be framed around a loop when the variable ($x$) is not modified within the loop body.

## Exam Tips
1. Be prepared to:
   - Identify suitable loop invariants
   - Prove invariant preservation
   - Show termination using variants
2. Common questions:
   - Verify given loop with invariant
   - Find invariant for given loop
   - Prove termination
3. Remember:
   - Modular verification principles
   - Frame rule application
   - Context of loop verification
