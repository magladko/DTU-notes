> >> HERE IS THE CONTEXT Overview

Team up with your AI sidekick to explore the components in the GPT2 simulator and translate them into properties that could be implemented in a "digital twin + AI" use case. When going through the GPT2 simulation try to make your AI sidekick adapt to your learning preferences by asking it to visualize concepts, explain them metaphorically or translate into Python code, to answer the following questions:

1. Tokenization

What is the aim of a tokenizer? What are the underlying principles for the encoding? Could these principles be applied to encoding not only text, but aspects relevant to digital twin representations of people or assets?

1. Embeddings

What are token embeddings? These representations of the text are learned during training of GPT2; what could they represent in a digital twin?

1. Attention

Even though attention does not implicitly encode syntax or semantics, could one argue that such relations between the tokens are reflected in the softmax scores? What could such structures represent in a digital twin?

1. Temperature

This parameter alters the output probability distribution for predicting the next token; How could this be used in a digital twin?

Deliverables

Use the ideas generated from translating GPT2 next token prediction into digital twin business value propositions. Map these functionalities out as core abilities using worksheet 1 from the EPFL business modeling tool. Subsequently combine them into potential product targeting segments representing different market opportunities. Copy and paste your conversation history with the AI sidekick into a text file so you can later summarize your interactions as part of the Assignment 1 hand-in. Conversations can be resumed by clicking on the top-left button in the chat interface. <<
