> • Source Code Verifier Architecture
>   * Frontend processes annotated source code through stages:
>     - Heaps
>     - Loops and procedures
>     - Functions & datatypes
>     - Loop-free programs
>     - Passive programs
>     - Proof obligations
>     - Final predicate logic (SMT)
> 
> • Key Verifier Design Considerations
>   * Program Semantics Modeling
>     - Type system representation
>     - State model design
>     - Language feature handling (concurrency, etc.)
>   * Abstraction Level
>     - Verification logic exposure vs. automation
>     - User expertise requirements
>     - Tradeoff between automation and completeness
>   * Verification Boundary Management
>     - External code/library integration
>     - Handling unsupported features
> 
> • Case Studies: Two Approaches
>   * Gobra (Go Verification)
>     - Exposes Viper capabilities directly
>     - High annotation overhead
>     - Requires deep verification expertise
>     - Enables full modular verification
>     
>   * Prusti (Rust Verification)
>     - Leverages Rust's ownership system
>     - Reduced annotation burden
>     - Automated safety proofs
>     - More accessible to programmers
> 
> • Rust Ownership System Integration
>   * Core Concepts
>     - Ownership = write permission
>     - Moving = permission transfer
>     - Borrowing = temporary permission lending
>   * Rules
>     - Single owner per location
>     - Scope-based disposal
>     - Move semantics
>   * Verification Benefits
>     - Automatic memory safety
>     - Simplified permission tracking
>     - Natural concurrency control
> 
> • Technical Challenges & Solutions
>   * Boundary Code
>     - "Trusted" annotations for unverified code
>     - Abstract method encoding
>     - Verification result qualification
>   * Implementation Scale
>     - Small annotated code → large verification conditions
>     - Example: 75 lines Rust → 1400+ lines Viper
>     - Complex proof obligations (>900k steps)
