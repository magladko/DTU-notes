# Encoding Verification Problems Notes

## Key Concepts

> [!note]
> The main idea is to develop an intermediate verification language $\IVL{1}$ on top of $\IVL{0}$ that extends it with common programming features like conditionals, assignments, and variable declarations with local scoping.

## Conditionals

> [!info] 
> For conditional choice $\Ite{\bb}{\cc_1}{\cc_2}$, the operational semantics is given by:

$$\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\mem \Satisfies \bb$}
\RightLabel{ite-true}
\UnaryInfC{$\tuple{\Ite{\bb}{\cc_1}{\cc_2}\tsep \mem} \qopStep \tuple{\cc_1, \mem}$}
\end{prooftree}$$

$$\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\mem \NotSatisfies \bb$}
\RightLabel{ite-false}
\UnaryInfC{$\tuple{\Ite{\bb}{\cc_1}{\cc_2}, \mem} \qopStep \tuple{\cc_2, \mem}$}
\end{prooftree}$$

Weakest precondition:
$$\wp{\Ite{\bb}{\cc_1}{\cc_2}}{\Post} \defqeq (\bb \Implies \wp{\cc_1}{\Post}) \qq{\And} (\Neg\bb \Implies \wp{\cc_2}{\Post})$$

> [!important] 
> Encoding to $\IVL{0}$:
> $$\cc_{cond} \defqeq \Begin\Assume{\bb}\Seq\cc_1\End\Choice\Begin\Assume{\neg\bb}\Seq\cc_2\End$$

## Assignments

### Basic Assignment
Form: $\Assign{\x}{\ee}$

Operational semantics:
$$\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{}
\RightLabel{assign}
\UnaryInfC{$\tuple{\Assign{\x}{\ee}\tsep \mem} \qopStep \tuple{\confTerm, \mem\iUpdate{\x}{\evalE{\ee}(\mem)}}$}
\end{prooftree}$$

### Dynamic Single Assignment Form (DSA)

> [!definition] 
> A command is in DSA if every assignment on a path assigns to a fresh variable.

> [!tip] Exam Tips
> - Pay attention to the DSA transformation process
> - Understand how it preserves safety
> - Be able to explain why DSA helps with verification

### Parallel Assignments
Form: $\Assign{\Sequence{\x}}{\Sequence{\ee}}$

> [!example]
> For swapping values:
> ```silver
> x, y := y, x  // parallel assignment
> ```
> Instead of:
> ```silver
> z := x
> x := y
> y := z
> ```

## Variable Declarations

Three main aspects:
1. Declaration placement
2. Re-declaration effects
3. Local scoping

> [!important] Key Rule
> Variables must be declared before use and can be redeclared if type remains unchanged.

### Blocks with Local Scope
Form: $\BlockBegin~\cc~\BlockEnd$

Encoding:
```silver
var y1,...,yn: T1,...,Tn := x1,...,xn  // enter block
cc
x1,...,xn := y1,...,yn                  // leave block
```

## Theorems & Definitions

> [!quote] Definition: $\IVL{1}$ Programs
> The set of $\IVL{1}$ programs extends $\IVL{0}$ with:
> - Conditional choices
> - Assignments (single and parallel)
> - Variable declarations
> - Block scoping

> [!example] Example: Sound Verification
When encoding $\IVL{1}$ to $\IVL{0}$:
$$\Valid \wp{\cc}{\Post} \qimplies \Valid \wp{\Havoc{\x}}{\Post}$$

Let's continue with the notes on encoding verification problems.

## Variable Declarations and Havoc

### Havoc Operation
> [!important] Definition
> $\Havoc{\x}$ operation forgets the value of variable $\x$, making it store an arbitrary value.

Operational semantics:
$$\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\tof{\x}{\TT}$}
\AxiomC{$\vv \in \UniverseOf{\TT}$}
\RightLabel{havoc}
\BinaryInfC{$\tuple{\Havoc{\x}\tsep \mem} \qopStep \tuple{\confTerm, \mem\iUpdate{\x}{\vv}}$}
\end{prooftree}$$

### Weakest Preconditions for Havoc
$$\wp{\Havoc{\x}} {\Post} \defqeq \Forall \tof{\x}{\TT}\qdot \Post$$

> [!note] Encoding Havoc to $\IVL{0}$
> Encode $\Havoc{\x}$ as $\Assign{\x}{\y}$ where $\y$ is fresh

## Initialized Declarations

Form: $\VarAssign{\x}{\TT}{\ee}$

> [!example] Example in Viper:
> ```silver
> method main() {
>   var x: Int := 16; // declare and initialize
>   x := x + 1;
>   assert x == 17
> }
> ```

### Parallel Initialized Declarations
Form: $\VarAssignSeq{\x}{\TT}{\ee}$

## Local Scope Blocks

### Block Encoding
For block $\BlockBegin~\cc~\BlockEnd$:

1. Save state on entry:
```
VarAssign{y1,...,yn}{T1,...,Tn}{x1,...,xn}
```

2. Execute block content:
```
cc
```

3. Restore state on exit:
```
Assign{x1,...,xn}{y1,...,yn}
```

### Block Inference Rule
$$\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\JudgeSyn \Triple{\Pre}{\cc}{\Post}$}
\AxiomC{$\Declared(\cc) \cap \VarsOf{\Post} \eq \emptyset$}
\RightLabel{block}
\BinaryInfC{$\JudgeSyn \Triple{\Pre}{\BlockBegin~\cc~\BlockEnd}{\Post}$}
\end{prooftree}$$

## $\IVL{1}$ Translation Process

> [!important] Steps to translate $\IVL{1}$ to $\IVL{0}$:
1. Encode conditionals 
2. Declare variables in preamble
3. Encode blocks with local scope
4. Transform variable declarations into assignments
5. Encode parallel assignments
6. Transform to DSA form
7. Declare fresh variables in preamble

> [!tip] Exam Tips
- Understand each transformation step
- Be able to explain why each step preserves program behavior
- Know how to justify soundness of encodings
- Practice transforming complex $\IVL{1}$ programs to $\IVL{0}$

## Important Lemmas and Theorems

1. **Soundness of Havoc Encoding**:
$$\Valid \wp{\cc}{\Post} \qimplies \Valid \wp{\Havoc{\x}}{\Post}$$

2. **Block Scope Invariant**:
For well-formed blocks, values of variables declared outside the block are preserved after block execution.

3. **DSA Property**:
In DSA form, for any path $\cc_1 \ldots \cc_n \Assign{\x}{\ee}$:
$$\x \notin \VarsOf{\ee} \cup \bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} \VarsOf{\cc_i}$$

Let's continue with the final part of the notes on encoding verification problems.

## Program Transformations and Verification Methodology

### Important FOL Properties for Verification

> [!important] Key Equivalences
For formulae $\ff$ and $\fg$:

1. Quantifier Distribution:
$$(\Forall\x\qdot \ff) \And (\Forall\x\qdot \fg) \qeq \Forall\x\qdot \ff \And \fg$$

2. When $\x \notin \VarsOf{\ff}$:
$$\ff \Implies \Forall\x\qdot \fg \qeq \Forall\x\qdot \ff \Implies \fg$$
$$\ff \And \Forall\x\qdot \fg \qeq \Forall\x\qdot \ff \And \fg$$

### Safety and Soundness

> [!note] Safety Preservation
For a sound encoding $\cc$ of verification condition $VC$:
$$\cc \text{ is safe} \qimplies VC \text{ holds}$$

## Match Command Exercise Analysis

> [!example] Match Command Structure:
```
match {
    b1 -> c1
    b2 -> c2
    b3 -> c3
}
```

Key points for analysis:
1. Conditions checked first
2. Nondeterministic choice among true conditions
3. Error if no condition holds

## Alert Command Exercise Notes

> [!tip] Implementation Considerations
For $\ccFont{alert}(\x,n)$:
1. Count steps
2. Set alarm after n steps
3. Consider verification conditions for time-dependent behavior

## Summary of Key Verification Rules

1. **Conditional Rule**:
```
wp(if b then c1 else c2, Post) = 
    (b => wp(c1, Post)) ∧ (¬b => wp(c2, Post))
```

2. **Assignment Rule**:
```
wp(x := e, Post) = Post[x/e]
```

3. **Block Rule**:
```
Pre -> wp(begin c end, Post) 
where Declared(c) ∩ Vars(Post) = ∅
```

> [!important] Final Exam Tips
1. Focus on understanding transformations between $\IVL{0}$ and $\IVL{1}$
2. Practice writing verification conditions
3. Be able to explain soundness arguments
4. Know how to handle local scoping
5. Understand DSA form importance

## Important Definitions Summary

1. **Dynamic Single Assignment (DSA)**:
Every assignment on any execution path assigns to a fresh variable.

2. **Block Scope**:
Variables declared in block are only accessible within that block.

3. **Havoc Operation**:
Makes a variable take on an arbitrary value of its type.

4. **Parallel Assignment**:
Simultaneous assignment of multiple values to multiple variables.

5. **Fresh Variable**:
Variable that has not appeared anywhere in the considered program before.

> [!note] Remember
The key to success in verification problems is methodical application of transformation rules while maintaining soundness at each step.

Let me continue with examination-style key points and potential questions from this lecture.

# Exam Preparation: Encoding Verification Problems

## Key Topics for Exam Questions

> [!tip] From Example Questions
Based on given example questions, you might be asked to:

1. **Explain Soundness**:
- Why is a verification technique sound?
- Give examples of features causing unsoundness
- Explain trusted code base implications

2. **Analyze Code**:
- Explain specific lines in your solution
- Explain Viper code fragments
- Verify if encodings/proof rules are sound/complete

3. **Verify Code**:
```silver
method test(n: Int) returns (sum: Int)
    requires n >= 0
    ensures sum == n * (n+1) / 2
{
    var i: Int := 0
    sum := 0
    while (i++ < n)
        invariant i <= n+1 && sum == i * (i-1) / 2
    {
        sum := sum + i
    }
}
```

## Common Question Patterns

> [!example] Example Questions You Should Be Ready For:
1. **Transformation Questions**
   - "How would you encode X into $\IVL{0}$?"
   - "Justify why your encoding is sound"

2. **Analysis Questions**
   - "Why does this code not verify?"
   - "What guarantees do we get from this verification?"

3. **Implementation Questions**
   - "How would you attempt to verify this code snippet?"
   - "Sketch an implementation of X in Viper"

## Key Points to Remember

> [!important] Critical Understanding
1. **Encoding Process**:
   - From high-level features to $\IVL{0}$
   - Each step must preserve semantics
   - Soundness requirements

2. **Variable Management**:
   - Declaration timing
   - Scope handling
   - Fresh variable creation

3. **Transformation Rules**:
   - DSA form
   - Block encoding
   - Parallel assignments

> [!warning] Common Pitfalls
1. Not justifying soundness properly
2. Forgetting to handle all edge cases
3. Incorrect variable scope handling
4. Missing steps in transformations

## Practice Questions

1. "Explain how you would encode a try-catch block into $\IVL{0}$."

2. "Given a parallel assignment x,y := e1,e2, show step by step how it's encoded in $\IVL{0}$."

3. "What are the implications of DSA form on verification? Why is it useful?"

4. "Show how to verify a block with local variables that shadows an outer variable."

> [!tip] Answering Strategy
1. Start with formal definition/semantics
2. Show transformation steps
3. Justify soundness
4. Consider edge cases
5. Provide concrete examples

Remember to tie your answers back to the core concepts of verification and always justify your reasoning steps!
