## General course objectives 

The purpose of the course is to introduce students to technologies for creating scalable startups leveraging the potential of generative AI, by utilizing high level application frameworks to simulate design concepts as a basis for assessing their business potential as well as societal impact.

During the course we will explore the underlying reasoning capabilities provided by transformer and diffusion based models, and map these abilities to novel value propositions structured as course assignments, using EPFL's business modeling tool ["The market opportunity navigator"](https://wheretoplay.co/) and MIT's ["Disciplined entrepreneurship"](https://www.d-eship.com/) approach.
