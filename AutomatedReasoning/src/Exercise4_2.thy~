lemma "\<exists> ys zs. xs = ys @ zs \<and>
      (length ys = length zs \<or> length ys = length zs + 1)"
proof -
  show "\<exists> ys zs. xs = ys @ zs \<and>
      (length ys = length zs \<or> length ys = length zs + 1)" 
(*  assume "xs = ys @ zs"
  then have "\<exists> ys zs. (length ys = length zs \<or> length ys = length zs + 1)" 
    using Ex_list_of_length by blast*)
