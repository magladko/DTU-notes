- Reflect on the growing demands for alternative protein sources for salmon feed and from where they might be sourced. 1 page limit Fishmeal
    

Task should not be more than 2400 - 4800 characters.

Students' report:

1. Provide a brief overview of the current uses of fishmeal, including aquaculture feeds Fishmeal is primarily used in aquaculture feeds for farmed fish and shrimp due to its high protein content and essential nutrients. It is also incorporated into the feed for livestock animals, like poultry, pigs, and cattle but also certain pet foods to enhance nutritional quality and growth. Additionally, fishmeal serves as a natural fertilizer [1]. However, it a fundamental component of aquaculture feeds, particularly for species like Atlantic salmon. Historically, fishmeal, along with fish oil, has been integral due to its rich protein content and essential fatty acids, which are crucial for the growth and health of farmed fish. In 1990, fishmeal and fish oil made up nearly 90% of the commercial diet for Atlantic salmon. However, due to sustainability concerns and overfishing, the proportion of marine ingredients in feed has dramatically decreased to less than 25% by 2020 [2]. The shift from fishmeal to alternative proteins is driven by the need to alleviate the pressure on marine ecosystems and enhance the sustainability of aquaculture. See Figure 1 in appendix for an overview of the fishmeal ingredients for Norwegian salmon from 1990 to 2020 [2].
    
2. What will the near future (e.g. 2050) protein demands be, if Atlantic salmon production continues to increase? When looking at the salmon production, both farmed and wild, 1.89 million tons was produced in 2000, around 2.7 million tons in 2010 and 3.8 million tons in 2020 [3]. From figure 2 the salmon production in 2050 can be estimated, assuming the production follows a linear progression. Figure 3 provides an overview of the protein demands for Norwegian salmon in 2020 (marine and vegetable). This provides a ratio between the protein demands and the salmon production in 2020 (~4 kg protein for every kg salmon). This same ratio can be used to estimate the protein demands in 2050, see figures 4 and 5. The salmon production could be estimated to be 6.78 million tons in 2050, resulting in the need for around 1.85 million tons of protein, which will be a 78% increase from 2020. However, the exact ratio between marine and vegetable protein sources would be harder to predict, since new and innovative sources are found continually.
    
3. Reflect on the growing demands for alternative protein sources for salmon feed and from where they might be sourced. Current fish feed is predominantly produced from soymeal. 85% of world fish population is already at its breaking limit [4]. Agricultural soybean production is already exceeding 350 million tonnes with approximately 80% being used in animal feed [5]. Both sources are unsustainable in meeting prospected fish feed demands. Alternative protein sources may stem from waste or byproducts, meaning existing but unutilized material, or from newly produced materials [6]. Unused materials with high protein content can stem from insects, animal byproducts and commercial by-products. New sources could be cell factories that are geared for high protein production [7]. Recent advances in sustainable protein synthesis, have found the utilisation of agricultural plant waste as a medium for cell growth. A Danish biotech startup: Nordic Virtual Pastures have constructed a process that purifies waste streams from the agricultural industry, using it in a media formulation which promotes high cell growth[8].

1. Excellent parts:

a) The overview of fishmeal usage in the first paragraph is excellent. It succinctly covers historical use, current trends, and reasons for change: "In 1990, fishmeal and fish oil made up nearly 90% of the commercial diet for Atlantic salmon. However, due to sustainability concerns and overfishing, the proportion of marine ingredients in feed has dramatically decreased to less than 25% by 2020." This efficiently conveys the significant shift in aquaculture practices and its drivers.

b) The quantitative analysis in the second paragraph is strong. It uses historical data to project future salmon production and protein demands: "The salmon production could be estimated to be 6.78 million tons in 2050, resulting in the need for around 1.85 million tons of protein, which will be a 78% increase from 2020." This provides clear, data-driven insights into future challenges.

2. Weak parts:

a) The discussion of alternative protein sources in the third paragraph lacks depth. While it mentions several potential sources, it doesn't provide enough detail on their viability, scalability, or comparative benefits.

b) The conclusion of the report is abrupt and focused on a single startup example, which doesn't effectively tie together the broader themes discussed earlier.

3. Specific suggestions for improvement:

a) Expand the analysis of alternative protein sources. Include a brief comparison of their nutritional profiles, production costs, and environmental impacts relative to fishmeal.

b) Add a brief discussion of potential policy measures or industry initiatives that could support the transition to more sustainable protein sources in aquaculture.

c) Conclude with a stronger synthesis of the key points, summarizing the challenges and opportunities in meeting future protein demands for salmon aquaculture while improving sustainability. This could include potential trade-offs and areas requiring further research or innovation.
